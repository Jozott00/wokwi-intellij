: The VS Code extension allows to connect to the serial port of the simulated microcontroller using an RFC2217 TCP server.

IoT Gateway
: The VS Code extension includes a bundled version of the Wokwi Private IoT Gateway, which allows to connect the virtual WiFi of the 
simulated ESP32 to your local network and the Internet.

Custom Chips

the <i>diagram.json</i> via a webgui within the editor.
